 <h1>Python</h1>   
 <h3><pre>Python is perhaps the most user-friendly programming language of any on 
 this list. It’s often said that Python’s syntax is clear, intuitive, and almost 
 English-like, which, like Java, makes it a popular choice for beginners.
Also like Java, Python has a variety of applications that make it a versatile, 
powerful option when choosing the best programming language for your use case. If 
you’re interested in back-end web development, for example, then the open-source 
Django framework, written in Python, is popular, easy to learn, and feature-rich. 
Django has been used in the development of some popular sites like Mozilla, 
Instagram, and Spotify.
Python also has packages such as NumPy and SciPy that are commonly used in the fields 
of scientific computing, mathematics, and engineering. Other Python libraries such as 
TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and OpenCV are used to build programs in data 
science, machine learning, image processing, and computer vision. Python's science 
and data applications make it a great choice for the academically inclined.
