 <h1>C#</h1>   
 <h3><pre>Like C++, C# (pronounced C Sharp) is a general-purpose, object-oriented 
 language built on the foundations of C. It was originally designed by Microsoft as 
 part of its .NET framework for building Windows applications.
C# uses a syntax that’s similar to other C-derived languages such as C++, so it’s easy 
to pick up if you’re coming from another language in the C family. C# is not only the 
go-to for Microsoft app development, but it’s also the language mobile developers use 
to build cross-platform apps on the Xamarin platform.
Additionally, anyone who is interested in VR development should consider learning C#. C# is the recommended language for building 3D and 2D video games using the popular Unity game engine, which produces one-third of the top games on the market.</pre>  </h3>
