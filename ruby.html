 <h1>Ruby</h1>   
 <h3><pre>Ruby is another scripting language that’s commonly used for web 
 development. In particular, it’s used as the basis for the popular Ruby on Rails web 
 application framework.
Beginners often gravitate toward Ruby because it has a reputation for having one of 
the friendliest and most helpful user communities. The Ruby community even has an 
unofficial saying, “Matz is nice and so we are nice,” encouraging members to model 
their kind and considerate behavior on Ruby’s chief inventor Yukihiro Matsumoto.
In addition to the active community and its straightforward syntax, Ruby is also a 
good language to pick up thanks to its association with great tech businesses. 
Twitter, Airbnb, Bloomberg, Shopify, and countless other startups have all built their 
websites using Ruby on Rails at some point.</pre>  </h3>
