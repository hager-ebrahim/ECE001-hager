 <h1>java</h1>   
 <h3><pre>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-
 oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is 
 intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that 
 compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for 
 recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on 
 any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
 The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities 
 than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming 
 languages in use according to GitHub,particularly for client-server web 
 applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</pre>  </h3>
